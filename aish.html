        precidence:-
        there are two or more css rules that point to the same element, then selector with highest precidence will
        win


        Every CSS selector has its place in the specificity hierarchy.

There are four categories which define the specificity level of a selector:

Inline styles - Example: <h1 style="color: pink;">
IDs - Example: #navbar
Classes, pseudo-classes, attribute selectors - Example: .test, :hover, [href]
Elements and pseudo-elements - Example: h1, ::before

Note: Inline style gets a specificity value of 1000, and is always given the highest priority!

Note 2: There is one exception to this rule: if you use the !important rule, it will even override inline styles!

Equal specificity: the latest rule wins - If the same rule is written twice into the external style sheet, then the latest rule wins:



ID selectors have a higher specificity than attribute selectors - Look at the following three code lines:

div#a {background-color: green;} /// this will work
#a {background-color: yellow;}
div[id=a] {background-color: blue;}


A class selector beats any number of element selectors - a class selector such as .intro beats h1, p, div, etc:
